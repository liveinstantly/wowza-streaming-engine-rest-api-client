# Wowza Streaming Engine REST API Client

This repository contains source codes for Wowza Streaming Engine REST API client.

This API client mainly contains the codes which are automatically generated by OpenAPI Generator tools ([openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)). OpenAPI Generator Tool is a tool to generate API client/server codes with Open API specification file(s) (such as JSON or YAML files) which describe the Open API specs of your target REST API services.

For Wowza Streaming Engine REST API, the REST API specifications are published at API docunmentation server endpoint URL of your Wowza Streaming Engine server instance. You can simply get Swagger v1 based spacification file (swagger.json) from the endpoint. But, there are some problems (or bugs) in the Wowza Streaming Engine spec JSON file, when using it to generate source codes with OpenAPI Generator tools. Some of this problems and/or bugs are related with Open API spec compliances.

That is my motivation and background to open and publish this repository to share our insights for developers who uses Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
